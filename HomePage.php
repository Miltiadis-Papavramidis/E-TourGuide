                <h3>Greek Islands</h3>
                <p>
According to the World Tourism Organization, Greece ranks 9th worldwide in terms of international tourist arrivals for 2022. According to the Border Survey of the Bank of Greece, the country receives at least 15 million tourists from abroad every year from 2015 onwards, with the only exception of 2020 due to the pandemic of Covid-19.

Most tourists come from Europe, especially the EU countries, and from the USA, while fewer originate from the other continents.

 
Why Greece?<br>
Greece is a famous country, popular for its clean beaches and rich history.<br>
Hundreds of archaeological and historical sites gloriously depict the country's past - besides, there is a reason why Athens is called an open-air museum!<br>
The landscape is mainly mountainous and the terrain is very fertile in the valleys that are scattered along the Greek mainland.<br>
Most of the mainland is also surrounded by water - by the Aegean and the Ionian Sea in particular.<br>
The country features around 6000 islands and islets, but only 227 of them are inhabited. They are the most popular Greek destinations, especially in summer. Big or tiny, green or arid, ideal for cosmopolitan or relaxing vacations, one thing is for sure: all have the requirements and facilities to offer you memorable and safe vacations!<br><br>

Some reputed island resorts are:<br>
• Mykonos, with its cosmopolitan character<br>
• Santorini, with the most romantic sunset in the world<br>
• Rhodes, the island of the knights, with its medieval castles and butterflies<br>
• Crete, with its revolutionary spirit<br>
• Ios, with its wild nightlife<br>
• Corfu, with its Venetian style<br>
• Ithaca, the homeland of Odysseus<br>
• Skiathos, with its long and sandy beaches<br>
All these constitute just a few examples of the most famous Greek paradises.<br>
Many have airports and are easily accessible via a flight from Athens or directly from other European cities. All of them are also accessible via ferry.<br><br>

                <h3>Traffic in Chalkidiki</h3>
                <p>Tourists coming from Serbia use the bypass around Thessaloniki not only to travel to Halkidiki but also when traveling to other popular destinations such as Thassos, Stavros, and Asprovalta. The bypass provides easier and faster access to these places, avoiding congestion in the center of Thessaloniki.<br>

To avoid congestion on the way to Halkidiki, especially during the summer season when the influx of tourists is highest, consider the following recommendations:<br>

Which routes to take to avoid congestion on the Thessaloniki bypass?<br>
While the main road to Halkidiki provides the fastest and most direct access, consider alternative routes that may have less traffic.<br>
Alternative routes:<br>

1. If you are traveling to Thassos, it is best to travel through Bulgaria.<br>
We believe that traveling to Thassos through Bulgaria is a better option not only because of the construction in Thessaloniki but in general.<br>
By going through Bulgaria to Thassos, you will bypass the mentioned congestion and arrive faster. <br>

2. As an alternative to the Thessaloniki bypass, it is recommended to use routes through the industrial zone and the city center, through Egnatia street or Nikis Avenue (the street along the coast).<br>
This route, which is already popular among tourists on their way to Halkidiki, can also be more enjoyable for lovers of Thessaloniki.<br> 
You can take the opportunity to take a break in Thessaloniki.<br>
The good news is that the works on Egnatia street have been completed, and all traffic lanes are now available, and the police have increased their presence and enforce a parking ban on Egnatia, Tsimiski, and Nikis streets for better traffic flow.<br>

3. You can always use the Dojran border crossing to completely bypass Thessaloniki.</p>
